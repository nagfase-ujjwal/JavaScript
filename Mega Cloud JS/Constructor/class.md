Q. variable? where do you declare a variable?

1. global scope
2. function (local / lexical scope)
3. block (block)

console.log(this); in the above three places

If we console.log(this) in global scope it gives Window object with key value pair
// "this" will always point to an object
// "this" is flexible; value of "this' changes
// "this" is a pointer that we use in JS to represent owner object
